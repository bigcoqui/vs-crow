Note: This Major Crow Mod was made from the love of 3 great guys that you should check out. (CaptainRyuji, ShroomKaboomz, and Renx The Hedgehog)
It includes a shit ton of references, jokes, music (well what we can make for a full fokin week without going like ljfnjler'ogjfrwn'gbojeqdr'ogbokhgvs:JFB:JKE BFjBFE with our keyboards 
yknow)
Everyone at F3 Really showed me what it was like being part of the big dogs yknow, it's really exhilarating to see that I got to talk with KADEDEV HIMSELF AND BE IN A SERVER WITH HIM
...ahem.
You can tell that I loved coding this, as it helps me learn how to be a modder in such a big community. While yes, the pain of coding was unbareable, I still pushed ahead and managed to get
through this. Not without help though. Funkin: Forward Had just a portion of the community grow together and help eachother with their projects as time continues forward. If Shroom had not
grabbed me, himself, and Renx a spot, you would have never even found this file in the offical mod files. I'm really glad you took your time to read this. It means the world to me, y'all. 
Please. Enjoy some Nefarious x Friday Night Funkin' if you have not already.
